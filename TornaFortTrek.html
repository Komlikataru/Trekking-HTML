                Torna Fort, also known as Prachandagad, is a historic hill fort located in the Sahyadri mountain range near Pune, Maharashtra. Standing at 1,403 meters (4,603 feet), it is the highest fort in Pune district. The fort is well known for its massive structure, breathtaking views, and strategic importance in Maratha history. It is situated 50 km from Pune and can be accessed via Velhe village, which serves as the base for trekking. The trek to the fort is about 7 km long and is considered moderately difficult due to its steep and rocky terrain. The fort is surrounded by other major forts like Rajgad, Sinhagad, and Purandar, making it an important watchtower for the Maratha Empire.The architecture of Torna Fort includes strong stone walls, bastions, and ancient gateways. The Bini Darwaja serves as the main entrance to the fort. Inside, one can find historical structures such as Zunjar Machi and Budhla Machi, both of which offer stunning views of the surrounding valleys. The Menghai Devi Temple (Toranaji Temple) is an important religious site inside the fort, where trekkers and devotees often visit. There are also several water tanks, reservoirs, and fortifications, indicating the fort’s ability to sustain long battles. The fort is best visited during the monsoon and winter months (June to February) when the surroundings are covered in lush greenery and mist. Today, Torna Fort remains a symbol of Maratha pride and courage, attracting history lovers, trekkers, and adventure seekers.

                Torna Fort’s origins date back to the 13th century, during the rule of the Shaiva Panth (followers of Lord Shiva). However, it gained major historical importance in 1646, when Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj, at the age of just 16 years, captured the fort and made it the first fort of the Maratha Empire. Recognizing its vast size and strong natural defenses, he renamed it Prachandagad, meaning "Massive Fort". It became an important stronghold for the Marathas, helping them expand their kingdom. Shivaji Maharaj also fortified the fort further, making it a crucial part of his early campaigns.In 1704, during the Mughal invasion of the Deccan, Emperor Aurangzeb captured Torna Fort and renamed it Futulgaib. However, after Aurangzeb’s death in 1707, the Marathas, under the leadership of Shahu Maharaj, recaptured the fort. Torna continued to play a key role in the Maratha and Peshwa administration until it was taken over by the British in 1818 during the Third Anglo-Maratha War. Despite centuries of battles and changes in ownership, Torna Fort stands strong as a monument of Maratha bravery and continues to inspire generations.
