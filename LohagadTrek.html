    Lohagad Fort, meaning "Iron Fort" in Marathi, is a historical hill fort situated in the Sahyadri Hills near Lonavala, Maharashtra. It stands at an altitude of 1,033 meters (3,389 feet) above sea level. The fort is known for its strategic importance and was used by various dynasties, including the Satavahanas, Rashtrakutas, Yadavas, Bahmanis, Nizams, Mughals, and Marathas.

Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj first captured Lohagad in 1648, but had to hand it over to the Mughals in 1665 due to the Treaty of Purandar. He later recaptured it in 1670 and used it to store loot from his expeditions, including the Surat campaign. The fort played an important role in the Maratha Empire before coming under British control in 1818 after the Anglo-Maratha Wars.Lohagad Fort is famous for its strong stone walls, bastions, and historical gates. It has four main entrances: Ganesh Darwaja, Narayan Darwaja, Hanuman Darwaja, and Maha Darwaja, each built with sturdy architecture to prevent enemy attacks. The fort is connected to Visapur Fort, which is slightly higher in elevation and was used for additional defense.Lohagad is a popular trekking destination, especially during the monsoon season, when the lush green landscapes and mist-covered surroundings make it a breathtaking experience. The trek is around 5 km (3 miles) long and is considered easy to moderate, making it ideal for beginners.The fort is located 52 km from Pune and 96 km from Mumbai, making it easily accessible for tourists and adventure enthusiasts. The nearest railway station is Malavli, which is about 10 km away. From Malavli, one can either trek or hire a vehicle to reach the base village of Bhaja.Lohagad Fort also has a deep cultural and religious significance, as it houses a few ancient temples and caves. The fort is close to Bhaja and Karla Caves, which are well-known Buddhist rock-cut structures from the 2nd century BC.
